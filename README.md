# FlappyBirdLias-build
Here you will find the built version (wich include the executable) of my first Unity project : "FlappyBirdLias". 
This game, which is a remake of the classic Flappy Bird, was a great training to learn the basics. 

If you want to download the project unbuilt to work on :

Enjoy my game !
